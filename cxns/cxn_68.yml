note: >
"This construction can have both an evidential and a mirative reading, depending on the surrounding context. 
It is often found in adversative (example1, example5), temporal, or more generally, coordinate clauses (example3), which favour a mirative "counterexpectation" reading 
(i.e., the event or state in the complement clause is in contrast with the speaker's expectations). 
More rarely, the external source of information is specified in the context, triggering an evidential interpretation (i.e., the speaker gets to know something from a source)."
