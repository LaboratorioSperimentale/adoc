definition: >
"The property described by the adjective is reduced in degree. If the property is the result of a process,
the process may be only partially fulfilled. In some cases, it is not the degree of the property that is reduced,
but it is the speaker that wants to refer to a property which is not properly correspondent to the one denoted by the adjective.
In some cases, the use of this construction conveys a pejorative evaluation by the speaker."

note: >
"While generally the insertion of an adjective in this construction does not change the category of the base,
in the case of very frequent lexically filled constructions, such constructions could be transposed as nominals,
often with a kin-categorization function"
