name: semiADJ

cxn-machine-readable: cxn_169.conllc

definition: >
    The property described by the adjective is reduced in degree. If the property is the result of a process,
    the process may be only partially fulfilled. In some cases, it is not the degree of the property that is reduced,
    but it is the speaker that wants to refer to a property which is not properly correspondent to the one denoted by the adjective.
    In some cases, the use of this construction conveys a pejorative evaluation by the speaker.
